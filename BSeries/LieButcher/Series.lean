# Lie–Butcher series

Following Munthe-Kaas–Wright (arXiv:math/0603023, Section 2), a Lie series
on a manifold is a formal sum `LS(α) = Σ_{ω ∈ OF} h^{|ω|} α(ω) F(ω)` over
ordered forests, determined by its coefficient family `α`. We work at the
coefficient level: an `LSSeries` is a function on ordered (planar) forests.

Two classes are distinguished by their behaviour under the shuffle product:

* **exponential (group-like)** series, the shuffle characters — these
  represent flows of Lie group integrators and form a group under the
  Grossman–Larson convolution (`PlanarForest.mkwConvolution`);
* **logarithmic (algebra-like)** series, which represent vector fields;
  by Ree's criterion these are the functionals vanishing on the empty
  forest and on all shuffle products of non-empty forests. A logarithmic
  series is the non-commutative generalization of a B-series, called a
  **Lie–Butcher series**.

As verification we check the paper's example: the commutator
`τ₁τ₂ - τ₂τ₁` of two trees is logarithmic, as is any single tree.
